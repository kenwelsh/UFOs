# UFOs


### Summary
This project was to build a website about UFO sitings, which displays an article and a data table of 111 records.  There is a filter section which enables the user to filter the table results with up to five different filters:
+ Date
+ City
+ State
+ Country
+ Shape


A potential future enhancement would be to allow the user to use a filter on the Comments field that selects records containing keywords or phrases.
